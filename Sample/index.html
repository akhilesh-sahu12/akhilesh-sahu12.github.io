    <h2>Thought of Day</h2>

        <p2>Sports is important</p2><br>
        Sports taught me work ethic, goal setting, leadership, teamwork, and how to handle things when they donâ€™t go your way. Sports taught me how to be humble, as I went through periods where I was a starter, scoring points, and winning games and times where I sat on the bench, played terrible, or lost a heartbreaker. Why is that important? Because those are all lessons you need to develop in life to be successful. Life isnâ€™t easy! On top of that, sports naturally develop deep relationships. A majority of my best friends, even today, are those I grew up with playing sports in elementary, high school, or college. Thatâ€™s why watching our King Kids play sports is so inspiring for me â€“ I know theyâ€™ll keep learning those lessons through sport and developing friendships that last forever.
        Have a good day!ðŸŒ¹</b></p>
